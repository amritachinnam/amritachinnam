Hi, Iâ€™m *Amrita Chinnam*â€”a Business Data Analyst who sees data as more than just numbers. To me, every dataset is a puzzle, revealing how people think, act, and make decisions. Iâ€™m fascinated by customer behavior and love uncovering the "why" behind their choices. With expertise in Power BI, Tableau, Python, SQL, and Machine Learning, I transform data into meaningful strategies that help businesses connect with their customers, optimize decisions, and drive real impact.
